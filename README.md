# Data Visualization Project

## Initial Topic
Data visualization project focused on airbnb data. We want to research the various fluctuation on people renting houses on airbnb, maybe classify the types of housing and see different patterns for airbnb in different cities.

Note: We added the New York airbnb dataset, but we can merge this dataset with other datasest from airbnb on different cities.
